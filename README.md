# Paraphraser-Tool
Built a paraphraser tool in English Language using natural language processing tool (NLP), an Artificial intelligence 
project that makes use of torch and parrot libraries in python. It takes input paragraphs, performs segmented conversion 
of the sentences, rejoins the sentences, and provides the output. Implemented using Google colab.
